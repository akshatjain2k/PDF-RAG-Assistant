We maintain appropriate procedures to verify age and eligibility to work at the time \nof employment. We will not knowingly place young workers in jobs that could compromise their health, welfare \nor mandatory education. \nWe are committed to ensuring that young people have opportunities to develop skills and work experience, so \nthey are ready to enter the labor force when they leave education.

People come first, and work is important in their lives. We trust, respect and \nprovide opportunities for all, transforming people's lives with jobs today and guiding them to jobs of tomorrow. \nOur global reach, working with hundreds of thousands of organizations around the world, means we \ncan influence the way people are treated across complex multinational supply chains. ManpowerGroup \nrecognizes the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and is committed to advancing the rights \nof everyone involved in or impacted by our operations. By promoting the internationally declared Fundamental \nPrinciples and Rights at Work, we can help ensure that work is a source of dignity and purpose for all.  \nWe use our industry leadership to advocate for ethical recruitment practices, employment flexibility balanced \nwith security, and opportunities for under-represented and vulnerable populations to develop in-demand skills \nand participate in the formal economy. \nOur policy is straightforward: We expect ManpowerGroup employees and business partners to conduct \nbusiness in a manner that respects Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We have a responsibility to \ncomply with all applicable laws in the countries where we do business. Where differences exist between local \nlaws and our standards, the higher standard will prevail. \nWe Have Zero Tolerance Toward Forced Labor and Modern Slavery \nForced labor (also known as modern slavery) occurs when individuals are coerced to work under threat of \npenalty, including violence, threats, intimidation, retention of identity papers, restricting freedom of movement, \nor manipulated debts. Requiring unreasonable working hours or paying workers less than minimum wage can \nalso be considered modern slavery. \nManpowerGroup will not make use of any form of forced labor, including bonded, indentured or prison labor \nand we will not knowingly do business with any entity that benefits in any way from these practices. \nWe do not charge fees to candidates or jobseekers for services related to temporary or direct placements. \nIn case such an incident is discovered, ManpowerGroup will reimburse the individual and will also seek reim- \nbursement from any supplier who may have violated this requirement. All employment is voluntary, and we will \nnot penalize or restrict the freedom of employees or associates to leave employment upon reasonable notice. \nWe will ensure that mandated working hours are reasonable and ensure fair and equitable compensation for \ntime worked, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. \n \n \nJonas Prising, Chairman & CEO"
